# About 

I am an assistant professor in the Department of electrical engineering at IIT Dharwad. I am interested in conducting fundamental research in inference and machine learning. Some of my work includes caching in cellular networks, federated learning, bilevel optimization, online optimization/learning, distributed stochastic optimization with applications to sensor networks, and signal processing for communication problems. If you are interested in any of the above, please drop me an email (**bharathbn AT iitdh DOT ac DOT in.**).

I am interested in hosting **undergraduates for internships**. I have a few success stories regarding publishing serious research papers with undergraduate students. If you are an undergraduate student with a strong inclination towards mathematics and would like to work with me, please drop in an email describing your interest and a short CV to **bharathbn AT iitdh DOT ac DOT in.** 

# Research Interests

Machine learning, statistics, signal processing, online learning, distributed optimization, federated learning, and wireless communication/networks.
