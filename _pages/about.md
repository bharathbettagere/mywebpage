# About 

I am an assistant professor in the department of electrical engineering at IIT Dharwad. My interest is to conduct fundamental research in the areas of inference and learning in the context of wireless networks. Some of my work include caching in cellular networks, federated learning with communication constraints, distributed stochastic optimization with applications to sensor networks, and signal processing for communication problems. If you are interested in any of the above, please drop in an email.

I am interested in hosting **undergraduates for internships**. I have a few success stories in terms of publishing serious research papers with undergraduate students. If you are an undergraduate student with strong inclination towards mathematics, and would like to work with me, please drop in an email describing your interest and a short CV to **bharathbn AT iitdh DOT ac DOT in.**

In addition to the above, I am actively collaborating with Euprime Pvt. Ltd. to convert my research into an impactful one! Akash Murthy (Co-founder, collaborator and research project member) is actively working with me on solving real world impactful problems related to federated learning.

#### Research

My research revolves around using tools from machine learning/statistics, signal processing, distributed optimization for application in wireless communications/networks and core areas of ML. Recently, I have been looking at problems in Federated Learning; see my publications for details.

#### Learning, Inference & Networks (LIaN) Lab

The main focus of the LIAN lab is to use learning and inference theories to solve problems related to wireless networks. The group also focuses on solving some challenging problems in the core areas of machine learning (both theory and practice).
