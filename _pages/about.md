# Looking for PhD and M. Tech by research students to work in the area of LLM and generative models. The second round of application is online. 

Apply for PhD here: https://iitdh.ac.in/phd

Apply for M. Tech by research here: https://iitdh.ac.in/mtech-research

There are 4 M. Tech by research and 4 PhD seats available in my group. Many opportunities are available in other areas as well!

# About 

I am an assistant professor in the Department of electrical engineering at IIT Dharwad. I am interested in conducting fundamental research in inference, machine learning and communication. I mainly work in the area of caching in cellular networks, federated learning, bilevel optimization, online optimization/learning, distributed stochastic optimization, and signal processing for communication problems. If you are interested in any of the above, please drop me an email (**bharathbn AT iitdh DOT ac DOT in.**).

I am interested in hosting **undergraduates for internships**. I have a few success stories regarding publishing serious research papers with undergraduate students. If you are an undergraduate student with a strong inclination towards mathematics and would like to work with me, please drop in an email describing your interest and a short CV to **bharathbn AT iitdh DOT ac DOT in.** 

If you have **Msc in mathematics or equivalent**, and is interested in working with me in theoretical machine learning or optimization theory, please send me an email along with your CV. 

# Research Interests

Machine learning, statistics, signal processing, online learning, distributed optimization, federated learning, and wireless communication/networks.
