# LIaN Lab

**Learning, Inference and Networks (LIaN) Lab**

The main focus of the LIAN lab is to use learning and inference theories to solve problems related to networks. We focus on using various tools such as probability theory, distributed stochastic optimization, machine learning, information theory and signal processing to solve some of the exiting real world problems, especially arising in the field of wireless communications/networks. See the publication list to get a view of the kind of problems that we address. Currently, the lab members are working in the area of caching in cellular network and federated learning with communication and privacy constraints.

My group consists of people from diverse background such as mathematics, computer science and electrical engineering. The following are the research members of my group:

- Shruti (PhD student)
- Sumit Sahu (PhD student)
- Akash Murthy (Co-founder of Euprime, collaborator and research project member)
- Amit Malaghan (JRF)

## News

- Our paper (with undergraduate student Shashank P) got accepted at ICASSP 2023!
- Our paper (with Sawan and Shruti) on Federated Learning got accepted at NCC 2022.
- **Sawan** successfully **defended** his MS thesis! Congratulations!!



Alumni list

- Sawan Mehara (now (Jan. 2022) at **NXP Semiconductors**, Bengaluru)
- Anuroop Sai (At **USC, Computer science**, Congratulations!)
