# Learning, Inference and Networks (LIaN) Lab

The main  focus of the LIAN lab is to use learning and inference theories to solve problems related to networks. We focus on using various tools such as  percolation theory, probability, large deviations, queuing theory,  machine learning to solve some of the exiting real world problems,  especially arising in the field of communications. A snapshot of the  problems considered so far is provided below. See the publication list  for the details [Publications](/publications/). Currently, the lab members are working in the area of caching in  cellular network and federated learning with communication and privacy  constraints. 

I am also a part of Euprime Pvt. Ltd.,  where my research on federated learning is being used in the development of non-contact health vital measurement. The following are group  researchers:

1. Sawan Mahara (MS by research)
2. Shruti (PhD student)
3. Yash Doshi (Undergrad project)
4. Samveed Desai (Undergrad project)
